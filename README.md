### Hi there, I am Sicelukwanda 👋

I do applied research at the intersection between Robotics and Machine Learning, working towards deploying learning-based algorithms on robots operating in the real-world where there are hard constraints and noisy sensor data. A short list of research areas/topics I work in includes: _safe reinforcement learning_, _generative modelling_, _imitation learning_, and _motion planning_.
- I'm an AI software engineer at [Kinisi Robotics](https://kinisi.com). 
- 🔭 I'm a PhD candidate (Successfully defended in Nov 2025!) at University College London, under the supervision of Prof. [Marc Deisenroth](https://www.deisenroth.cc).
- 📑 I train and deploy ML models across robot perception and manipulation, with a strong emphasis on robust real-world performance.
- 🌱 I'm helping build a community of researchers and professionals in robotics and machine learning on the African continent. _See our Robot Learning workshops:_ [2023](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa/home), [2024](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa-2024), and [2025](https://sites.google.com/view/robot-learning-for-africa-2025/home).
