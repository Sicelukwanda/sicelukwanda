### Hi there, I am Sicelukwanda ðŸ‘‹

I do research at the intersection between Robotics and Machine Learning, working towards deploying learning-based algorithms on robots operating in the real-world where there are hard constraints and noisy sensor data. A short list of research areas/topics I work in includes: _safe reinforcement learning_, _generative modelling_, _imitation learning_, and _motion planning_.

- ðŸ”­ I'm a PhD student at University College London, under the supervision of Prof. [Marc Deisenroth](https://www.deisenroth.cc).
- ðŸ“‘ Iâ€™m currently looking at ways to incorporate safety constraints into probabilistic models for planning in high-dimensional robot systems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm helping build a community of researchers and professionals in robotics and machine learning on the African continent. _See our Robot Learning workshops:_ [2023](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa/home) and [2024](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa-2024).
