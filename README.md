### Hi there, I am Sicelukwanda ðŸ‘‹

I do research at the intersection between Robotics and Machine Learning, working towards deploying learning-based algorithms on robots operating in the real-world where there are hard constraints and noisy sensor data. A short list of research areas/topics I work in includes _safe reinforcement learning_, _generative modelling_, _imitation learning_, and _motion planning_.

- ðŸ”­ I'm a PhD student at University College London, under the supervision of Prof. [Marc Deisenroth](https://www.deisenroth.cc)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking at ways to incorporate safety constraints such as self-collisions for high-dimensional robot systems into probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes.
